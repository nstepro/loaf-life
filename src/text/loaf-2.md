### What you need
#### Primary Ingredients
 - King Arthur bread flour
 - Salt
 - Sourdough starter
 - Large mixing bowl
 - Dutch oven (no plastic parts)
#### Optional Ingredients
 - _Spelt or whole wheat flour_
 - _Kitchen scale_
 - _Banneton basket_
 - _Rice flour_

> #### Notes about Ingredients & Equipment
> ##### Flour
> **King Arthur brand** is the best widely-available option for bread flour. Other brands are fine for whole wheat and spelt flour.
>
> **Bake with bread flour** (as opposed to all-purpose flour). Bread flour has more protein, which makes a stronger gluten network. This makes an easier-to-shape loaf with a chewier, bouncier crumb.
>
> **When feeding your starter**, it doesn't matter whether you use bread flour or all-purpose flour, but use some sort of white flour. Do not feed your starter with whole grain flour.
>
> **Store whole grain flour in the fridge or freezer**. Unlike white flour, whole wheat will spoil if kept at room temperature.
> 
> ##### Scale
> Weighing ingredients (especially flour) is more accurate than measuring by volume. The scale is not necessary, but it will result in more consistent loaves.
> 
> ##### Dutch oven
> Use any Dutch oven that is at least 5 quarts in capacity and is oven safe. This means no plastic parts that will melt at high temperatures. 
> 
> If you use a non-enameled cast iron Dutch oven (I use [this Lodge one](https://www.lodgecastiron.com/product/dutch-oven?sku=L8DOL3)), be aware that if you use it for other things besides bread, especially anything with oil, it could get smoky when you're preheating it in the oven. To avoid this, I use my Lodge Dutch oven only for baking bread. Another solution is to use an enameled-coated Dutch oven, which is not porous.  

### Philosophy of the recipe
This recipe is just one way to consistently make an excellent loaf of bread. Each variable could be changed, and it would probably still make a great loaf.

So, relax.  If you deviate from the instructions, no big deal. If you adjust the timing to suit your lifestyle (intentionally or not), no big deal. It's really hard to mess this up. Your loaves will be delicious.

### Sourdough Starter
Sourdough starter is a cultivated colony of bacteria and yeast. Once mature and strong, it needs little maintenance and can live forever. It thrives on just flour and water. 

Keep your starter in the fridge in a closed jar, and make sure it doesn't completely fill up the jar, because it might expand.

Once every week or two, either bake with your starter or just feed it. This will keep it alive and healthy.

#### How to feed your starter
For each feeding, the general idea is to double the total volume of starter by adding flour and water.  

Here's how: 
- Take the starter out of the fridge
- If you have time, let the jar sit out for an hour or so to warm up
- Mix the starter with a spoon (there might be liquid on top)
- Put **9 oz.** (1 cup) **starter** into a small bowl (discard the rest, if any)
- Add **4 oz.** (½ cup) room temperature **water**
- Add **3 oz.** (generous ½ cup) **flour** 
- Mix well
- Cover (with reusable plastic, a lid, a plate, or tin foil, etc.) and leave out on the counter for 4-6 hours
- Discard all but **9 oz.** (1 cup) starter

If you took your starter out to feed it for maintenance, not for baking, pour it into a clean jar with a lid, and pop it back in the fridge.

If you're baking with your starter, you will feed it three times (see below). 

> #### How sourdough starter is made
> The basic method for making sourdough starter uses just flour and water. [King Arthur has a widely used method.](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/sourdough-starter-recipe)
> 
> My starter was made in the summer of 2020 using Nancy Silverton's method as described in [Breads from the La Brea Bakery.](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/nancy-silvertons-breads-from-the-la-brea-bakery-recipes-for-the-connoisseur_nancy-silverton/258756/item/3234322/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA3fiPBhCCARIsAFQ8QzWMiIZBzE56mOxMnizaFWuXfCz8vWe88r9dITmuApmAAm4BEydIL6waAsGvEALw_wcB#idiq=3234322&edition=2269156) This method takes longer than the King Arthur method and uses organic grapes along with the flour and water. It produced an exceptional (and very reliable) homemade starter.

> If you got your starter from me and need a replacement (for any reason), just let me know. I intend to maintain mine forever.

### How to bake the bread

Baking is a 3-day process. This sounds intense, but it's not. There's a lot of time between steps, and everything is flexible.

#### Day 1: feed the starter 3 times
##### _First feeding_ 
In the morning, take your starter out of the fridge and discard all but **9 oz.** (1 cup). Feed it with **4 oz.** (½ cup) water and **3 oz.** (generous ½ cup) flour
##### _Second feeding_
After 4-6 hours, discard all but **9 oz.** (1 cup) starter again and feed it again. 
##### _Third feeding_
After another 4-6 hours (ideally, right before you go to bed) discard all but **9 oz.** (1 cup) starter again and feed it a third time. 

Leave the starter out overnight, at room temperature and covered. 

#### Day 2: make and ferment the dough
##### _Make the dough_
In the morning, after the starter has been sitting out overnight for about 8-12 (no more than 15) hours, make the dough out of flour, water, salt, and starter. You'll mix the ingredients in two steps. 
###### _Step 1: Autolyse_
Mix the flour and water first and let it rest before adding the starter and salt. This first step, called the "autolyse," helps form gluten and enhances the texture. 

Put these ingredients into a large mixing bowl:
 - **500 grams (3 cups) flour**
   - For a fluffy white loaf, use all bread flour. 
   - For a heartier loaf, use a mix of bread flour and whole grain flour. I recommend using 50g to 100g (¼ to ½  cup) whole grain flour.
  -  **Room temperature water**   
	  - If using all bread flour: 350 grams (1½ cup) water
	  - If using a mix: 385 grams (1⅔ cup) water

Using a wooden spoon or your hands, mix the flour and water together to form a sticky dough. 

Cover the bowl and rest for about **45 minutes.**
###### _Step 2: Add salt & starter_
Add these ingredients to the dough, in this order:
-  **10 grams (1¾ tsp.) salt**
	 - Mix with your hand or a spoon to distribute
 - **75 grams (⅓ cup) starter** 
   - Mix the starter before adding it to the dough
   - After adding the starter, mix the dough with your hand or a spoon to incorporate as best you can (the starter will not be fully mixed in and the dough will feel slimy)
   - **IMPORTANT:** do not discard the rest of the starter! Put **9 oz.** (1 cup) in a jar and put it back in the fridge (this is how you maintain your starter for years, decades, etc.)

> ##### Short on time? Skip the autolyse.
> If you're in a hurry, mix all the ingredients together at once and skip the 45 minute rest. This will still make a great loaf.  

##### _Stretch and fold 4 times_
After mixing the ingredients, let the dough rest for **1-2 hours.** 

Then, do 4 rounds of "stretch and folds." This helps the dough rise and build its gluten structure. 

Each round consists of 4 folds. Slide your hand under the dough, grab a handful, stretch it up, and fold it over the top. Rotate the bowl one quarter and repeat. Do this twice more so that you've stretched and folded all four "corners" of the dough. 

After each round of stretch and folds, cover the dough and let it rest for about **45 minutes.** With each round, the dough should feel smoother, more elastic, and less sticky.

##### _Bulk fermentation_
After the last stretch and fold, let the dough sit out on the counter, in the bowl and covered, for **several hours.** It will rise and get bigger.

Then, put the bowl in the fridge and leave it overnight.

> ##### _When to put it in the fridge_
> The purpose of putting the dough into the fridge is to slow down the activity of the yeast, which allows for a longer fermentation and makes better flavor. 
> 
> The ideal time to put the dough in the fridge is when it has risen a decent amount and feels lively and springy if you put your hand on it. 
> 
> If you wait until it has climbed up to the top of the bowl and feels like it's mostly air, it's probably over-fermented (which means it will be harder to shape and will make a flatter loaf). If you put it in the fridge before it has had a chance to rise and get some air in it, it's probably under-fermented (which makes a denser, gummier loaf).  
> 
> The timing depends on temperature. If your kitchen is warmer, it will take less time to ferment; if cooler, more time. If it's winter and your kitchen is really cold, you might want to skip the fridge altogether and leave the dough on your counter overnight.   

#### Day 3: Shaping, final proof, and baking

##### _Shaping_
In the morning (or afternoon, doesn't matter), take the bowl out of the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for **1-2 hours** to warm up.

Once the dough is close to room temperature, sprinkle a little flour on the counter and dump the dough out. If the dough is huge and has a lot of big air bubbles in it, press it down gently with your hands to get some of the air out. 

Shape your loaf into a boule. 

After shaping, either leave the dough right side up on the counter or invert it into a banneton basket. Either way, sprinkle a little flour on it and cover loosely.

> ##### _Banneton baskets_
> A banneton basket (proofing basket) is a wooden basket that is only used for rising shaped bread dough. They come in different shapes, but a round one works best for a boule. 
> 
> How to use a banneton basket: 
>  - Before each use, sprinkle some rice flour into the basket, distribute it, and dump out the excess (rice flour is best for keeping the dough from sticking to the basket because it resists moisture more than wheat flour) 
>  - Pick up your shaped dough and place it upside down in the basket 
>  - Leave it there for the final proof 
>  - When ready to slash and bake, gently turn the dough out onto your counter so that it's right side up 
>  - Do not wash the basket between uses, just shake out some of the excess flour

[Video: Boule shaping](https://youtu.be/4MLKYR6ucVk)

 ##### _Proof & pre-heat_
After the dough is shaped, it needs to proof for about **1½ hours** before baking. During this time, you will preheat your oven and your Dutch oven. 

After your dough has been proofing for **45 minutes**, put your empty Dutch oven inside your oven, with the lid on, and turn the oven to **475 degrees**. Set a timer for **45 minutes.** 

After the oven (and Dutch oven) have been preheating for about 45 minutes, and your dough has been proofing for about 1½ hours, it's time to bake.
> ##### _How to know when the dough is ready to bake_
> During its final proof, the dough will expand a bit and will probably flatten if it's not in a banneton basket. 
>
>1½ hours is a good guide, but you should use the "poke" test to see if your dough is fully proofed and ready to bake before putting it in the oven. Give the dough a poke with your fingertip or knuckle. It should bounce back slowly and leave a small indentation. If it immediately bounces all the way back, it needs more time. 


##### _Slash & into the oven_
If your dough is in a banneton basket, take off the covering and gently invert the dough onto the counter. If it's not in a basket, just take off the covering. 

Slash the dough by making an X in the top of the loaf, using a sharp knife or razor blade. The X should take up most of the top of the loaf and should be no more than ½ inch deep. This helps the dough rise in the oven. 

Carefully, with oven mitts, take the hot Dutch oven out of the oven and remove the lid. Take off the mitts, put flour on your hands, pick up the dough and plop it into the hot Dutch oven. Put on your mitts, put the hot lid back on, and put the Dutch oven back in the oven. 

[Video: Slash and Load](https://youtu.be/4MLKYR6ucVk)

##### _Baking_ 
The baking has two stages: higher temperature with the Dutch oven lid on, followed by lower temperature with the lid off, for a total of 47 minutes. 

With the **lid on**, bake for **30 minutes** at **475 degrees**.

Then, take the **lid off**, turn the temperature down to **450 degrees**, and bake for another **17 minutes**.

The bread is done when the crust looks pleasantly dark and caramelized but not burnt. If using all bread flour, it will be lighter; if mixing with whole grain flower, it will be darker. 

Oven temperatures vary. Adjust the baking time for what works best in your oven. 

If the bottoms of your loaves are coming out burnt, put the Dutch oven on top of a cookie sheet instead of directly on the oven rack.

Using oven mitts, dump the loaf out onto a cooling rack and turn it so it's right side up.

Let the loaf cool **completely** before cutting into it (2-3 hours). The texture will be gummy if you cut it open when it's still warm. 

> ##### _For an even crustier loaf_
> If you like a really thick, chewy crust: Turn the oven off after it's done baking, prop the oven door open about a foot, and leave the bread inside for 10-20 minutes before taking it out.

### Enjoy!
