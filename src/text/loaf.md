#### Notes about flour ####

**King Arthur brand** is the best option for bread flour and all-purpose flour. Other brands are fine for whole wheat and spelt flour.

**Bake with bread flour** (as opposed to all-purpose). It will give you a better loaf, because it has more protein. You can bake with all-purpose flour if necessary.

**When feeding your starter**, it doesn't matter whether you use bread flour or all-purpose flour. Do not feed your starter with whole grain flour.

**If you buy spelt, whole wheat**, or some other whole grain flour, store it in the fridge or freezer. Unlike white flour, whole grain flour will spoil if kept at room temperature.

#### Notes about the scale ####

The kitchen scale is not necessary, but it makes things easier and more accurate. My recipe uses weights rather than volume measures, but I can convert it next time I bake if you don't have a scale. Just let me know.

### Starter Basics ###

Sourdough starter is a cultivated colony of bacteria and yeast. Once it is mature and strong, it doesn't need a lot of maintenance and can live forever. It thrives on just flour and water. Here are the basics for caring for your starter.

Keep it in the fridge in a closed jar, and make sure it doesn't completely fill up the jar.

To keep the starter alive and healthy, about once a week you should either bake with it or just "feed" it.

#### How to feed your starter ####

- Mix it up with a spoon (it's normal for there to be some liquid on top after it's been in the fridge for a while)
- Put about 8 oz. (one cup) of the starter into a bowl (discard the rest, if there is any)
- Add 4 oz. (1/2 cup) room temperature water and 2.5 oz. (1/2 cup) flour and mix well
- Cover with plastic wrap and leave out on the counter for 4-6 hours
- Mix it up, put 8 oz. into a clean jar with a lid, and pop it back in the fridge (discard the extra)

### How to bake the bread ###

Baking is a three day process, which sounds intense, but it's not that time consuming. There is just a lot of time between steps. Perfect for when you work from home.

#### Day 1: feed the starter 3 times ####

In the morning, take the starter out of the fridge, mix it up, and put 8 oz. into a bowl (discard the rest).

Feed it with 4 oz. water and 2.5 oz. flour.

Cover with plastic wrap and let it sit for 4-6 hours.

Mix it up, discard all but 8 oz., and feed it again.

Do this a third time.

After the third feeding, which should ideally be right before you go to bed, leave the starter covered on the counter (don't put it in the fridge).

#### Day 2: make and proof the dough ####

##### _Make the dough_ #####
In the morning, make the dough out of flour, water, starter, and salt. If you use whole grain flour, you need a little more water than if you use all white flour. Put all of these ingredients into a big mixing bowl:

> Detailed Recipes
> - **500 grams of flour**
>   - This can be all white bread flour, or it can be a mix of white bread flour and a whole grain flour like spelt of whole wheat. If doing a mix, use no more than 100 grams of the whole grain flour.
> - **Room temperature water**
>   - If all white flour: 350 grams of water
>   - If mixed white and whole grain flour: 385 grams of water
> - **75 grams of starter** that you fed the day before
>   - Mix it up first
>   - IMPORTANT: do not discard the rest of the starter! Put 8 oz. in a clean jar, with a lid, and put it back in the fridge. (This is how you maintain your starter for years, decades, etc.)
> - **10 grams of salt**

Mix everything up with a wooden spoon and/or your hand until there is no more dry flour left. It should be messy and sticky.

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit on your counter for 1-2 hours.

##### _Stretch and fold_ #####

After the dough has been sitting for at least 1 hour, "stretch and fold" it every 30 minutes to an hour, 4 times total. Stretching and folding is a technique that helps the dough rise and build a gluten structure. It's not fussy, the idea is just to stretch out some of the dough and fold it back onto itself. After each stretch and fold, cover the bowl with plastic wrap again. During this process the dough starts to feel more elastic and smooth, and less sticky. Here's how to stretch and fold: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DEKlBYimlQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DEKlBYimlQ)

After the last stretch and fold, let the dough sit out on the counter, in the bowl and covered with plastic wrap, for another few hours. It will rise and get bigger.

##### _Overnight fermentation_ #####

A few hours after the last stretch and fold, pop the bowl in the fridge and leave it overnight.

#### Day 3: Shaping, final rise, and baking ####

##### _Shaping_ #####

In the morning (or afternoon, it doesn't really matter), take the bowl out of the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for an hour or two to warm up.

Once the dough is close to room temperature, press it down gently with your hands to get some of the air out. Then sprinkle some flour onto the counter and dump the dough out. This is when you shape your loaf. You will be making a round loaf, called a "boule," because it fits nicely into a Dutch oven.

Here's how to shape a boule: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMspoBQRrEs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMspoBQRrEs)

(Note: I usually don't do two rounds of shaping like he does in this video, but I also don't think it's a bad idea)

After shaping, some people (including me) use a "banneton" basket, also called a proofing basket, for the final rise. This helps the dough keep its shape. It is not essential. If you want to learn more about proofing baskets, there are lots of videos on YouTube.

If you do not have a proofing basket, just leave the dough on the floured counter, shaped and right side up, for its final rise. Either way, sprinkle a little flour on the top of the dough and cover loosely with plastic wrap.

##### _Final rise_ #####

After the dough is shaped, it needs to do a final rise for about 1 ½ hours before baking. During this time it will expand somewhat and probably flatten if it's not in a basket. All good.

When you start the final rise, set a timer for 45 minutes.

After 45 minutes, it's time to turn on the oven. Put an empty Dutch oven inside your oven (you may have to remove some racks to make it fit), with the lid on, and turn the oven to 475 degrees. Set a timer for 45 minutes.

After the oven (and Dutch oven) have been heating for about 45 minutes, it's time to bake!

First, slash your dough. Take off the plastic wrap, and make a quick "X" in the top of the loaf, using a sharp paring knife or razor blade. The X should take up most of the top of the loaf and should be no more than ½ inch deep. This helps the dough rise in the oven.

Carefully, with oven mitts, take the hot Dutch oven out of the oven and remove the lid. Take off the mitts, put some flour on your hands, and then pick up the dough and plop it into the hot Dutch oven. This will be a bit messy, but don't worry about it, just concentrate on not burning your hands. Put the lid back on and put the Dutch oven back in the oven. Set a timer for 27 minutes.

##### _Baking_ #####

Bake for 27 minutes with the lid of the Dutch oven on, then remove the lid and turn the temperature down to 450 degrees. Bake the bread for another 17 minutes.

After the 17-minute bake, take the Dutch oven out of the oven. Using oven mitts, dump the loaf out onto a cooling rack (it should come out easily, but it will of course be very hot, so be careful). Turn it so it's right side up on the rack.

Let the loaf cool **completely** before cutting into it. This will take about 3 hours. The waiting is hard, but it's worth it. The texture will be gummy if you cut it open when it's still warm.

**Note:** oven temperatures vary a lot. Your cooking time might be shorter or longer than my cooking time. The bread is done when it looks pleasingly dark but not burnt. If you use some whole grain flour, it will be darker than if you use all white flour.

**Also note:** if the bottoms of your loaves are coming out burnt, put your Dutch oven on a flat cookie sheet instead of directly on the oven rack.

### Enjoy! ###
